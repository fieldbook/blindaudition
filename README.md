Blind Audition
==============

Blind Audition is a Chrome Extension that anonymizes candidates on
recruiting-related sites such as AngelList and LinkedIn, by hiding their names
and profile pictures. Using it helps you focus on their qualifications instead
of irrelevant details.

How to get it
-------------

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blind-audition/chhkegnhdpnnkdeifjclncaifijfjfjm)

How to help
-----------

We accept pull requests! We could use support for more sites--writing an
adapter for a particular site is pretty simple. Also, the blinding could be
more thorough and consistent on the pages we do support.

Also, designers: The project could use a real logo, and maybe even a homepage!

We're hiring
------------

Blind Audition is sponsored by [Fieldbook](https://fieldbook.com). If you like
